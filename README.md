# PrusaSlicer-Anet-A8-Profile
This is a PrusaSlicer profile for Anet A8 3D printer. You can use this as your starting point and configure your printer accordingly. 
If you are using ABL, make sure to edit "Custom G-code" under "Printer settings".
I have set acceleration values for my own Anet A8, which is pretty much a stock besides than buildtak plate.
Make sure to calibrate your retraction settings.
I included my filament settings along with 3 different print settings so you should be able to download this profile and print using ABS or PLA straight away.
